<h1>why</h1>
This project is created for Coderdojo Lier. <br>
More specific for the event "Supervlieg" in the city of Lier (Belgium) aimed at entertaining children age 4-12yrs. 
<br>
<h1>what</h1>
Paper planes folded by the chilren are shot from a launching system controlled by a microbit. They are aimed
at a wall with a round opening (the sound barrier).  If the paper plane gets through the hole, it is detected by a laser, controlled by an arduino nano.
It then shows some light effects and sends a serial message to an attached PC that plays some cool sounding sound effects.
